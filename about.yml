description: 
Crew management is currently done leveraging several tools depending on the location: excel, compass, PEX, whiteboards, Metrics, access databases, and hard copies of schedules. This is a slow and error filled process that results in wasted man hours and overstaffing of missions.  The Crew Management Tool is aimed to reduce the amount of tools that a scheduler has to review in order to plan a single mission by combining all data into a single tracker to help reduce the time wasted searching for data. The application will also integrate mission information to allow for planning to exist within the same application in order to reduce the number of errors due to transcription and to pave the way for future automatization. This is in an effort to create a corporate base line, so that data across locations is consistent. The application will reside on NGAâ€™s NIPR PCF and use MDDS to transfer to a mirrored PCF on JWICS.
